# Palette Picker

## Overview:

Palette Picker is a paired project during MOD-4 of Turing School of Software and Design
- We were given roughly 9 days to complete an MVP

#### Learning Goals for this project were:
- Server-side testing using `knex` and `supertest`
- Furthering the understanding of CRUD endpoints
- Using CORS to connect the front and back end
- Using multiple environments (i.e. development, testing, CI, and production)
